# Product Requirements Document: PDF Quality Control (QC) Analyzer

## 1. Problem
Marketing teams and organizations struggle to ensure the quality of PDF collateral, like datasheets with text and images (e.g., "CURVES DATA SHEET"), due to unreliable text extraction (e.g., "available" misread as "wailable") and undetected visual formatting issues (e.g., misaligned lines, inconsistent fonts). This leads to inconsistent branding, delayed releases, and reputational risks, as manual QC is slow and misses critical errors in both content and layout.

## 2. High Level Approach
We will develop a single-page web application, hosted publicly on our website using Next.js and deployed on Vercel, integrating **pdf-parse** with **Tesseract.js** for accurate text extraction from text-and-image PDFs, **LanguageTool** for content validation, and **OpenCV** for visual layout analysis including font consistency and line alignment. This public tool will empower any organization to upload PDFs and receive precise, automated QC reports, ensuring professional-grade marketing collateral with minimal effort.

## 3. Narrative
- **Common Case:** Lisa, a marketing manager at a small firm, uploads a datasheet PDF with text and images to our website. The tool correctly extracts "Additional fit equations available for protocol data analysis," suggests a style tweak for "IC50," and confirms all fonts and lines are aligned, allowing her to finalize the collateral in under 10 minutes.
- **Edge Case:** Tom, a freelancer, uploads a PDF with a corrupted image section repeating "COMPAR." The tool flags it as unreadable, ensures text like "protocol" isn't misread, and verifies font consistency across pages, helping him fix the source file before client delivery.

## 4. Goals
### 4.1 Metrics
- **Text Extraction Accuracy:** Achieve 99% accuracy on text-and-image PDFs (e.g., no "wailable" for "available" or "probocol" for "protocol").
- **Formatting Detection Rate:** Identify 99% of visual formatting issues (e.g., font inconsistencies, line misalignments).
- **Processing Time:** Complete QC for a 2-page PDF in under 5 seconds.
- **User Efficiency:** Reduce QC time by 50% (e.g., from 20 minutes to 10 minutes per PDF).

### 4.2 Impact Sizing Model
- **Starting Assumption:** 5 users (e.g., small team) review 50 PDFs/month, each taking 20 minutes manually = 1,000 minutes/month.
- **With Tool:** 10 minutes/PDF = 500 minutes/month, saving 500 minutes ($416.50 at $50/hour).
- **Scaling Scenario:** 100 users (early adoption) = 1,000 PDFs/month, saving 10,000 minutes ($8,333/month). Scales linearly with user growth.

## 5. Non-goals
- **Content Validation:** Checking factual accuracy (e.g., equation correctness) is out of scope; focus is on text and formatting.
- **Non-PDF Formats:** Initial release supports PDFs only, not DOCX or others.
- **Offline Use:** Tool is web-based; no standalone desktop version planned.

## 6. Solution Alignment
This aligns with our strategy to provide accessible, high-value tools to external organizations via our website, leveraging Vercel's scalability and open-source libraries (**pdf-parse**, **Tesseract.js**, **LanguageTool**, **OpenCV**) to ensure cost-effective, reliable QC for marketing PDFs. It meets the need for professional collateral by addressing both text accuracy and visual polish, differentiating us in the market.

## 7. Key Features
### 7.1 Plan of Record
- **File Upload:** Drag-and-drop PDF upload (10MB limit) on website.
- **Text QC:**
  - **pdf-parse + Tesseract.js:** Extract text from text-and-image PDFs (e.g., "available," not "wailable").
  - **LanguageTool:** Validate spelling, grammar, style (e.g., "IC50" consistency, fix "dat" to "data").
- **Visual QC:**
  - **OpenCV:** Analyze font consistency (e.g., same typeface across "INTEGRATE" and body), line alignment (e.g., bullets, rules), spacing (e.g., "CURVES DATA SHEET" to "INTEGRATE"), and flag anomalies (e.g., "COMPAR" repetition as image corruption).
- **Report UI:** Interactive report with "Text Issues" (e.g., "Missing comma after 'equations'") and "Formatting Issues" (e.g., "Font mismatch: 12pt vs. 11pt") tabs; export to PDF/CSV.
- **Settings:** Toggle text vs. visual QC; adjust formatting thresholds (e.g., font size variance).

### 7.2 Future Considerations
- **Multi-Format Support:** Add DOCX with **mammoth.js**.
- **User Accounts:** Optional login for history and preferences.
- **Premium Features:** Batch processing or priority support for high-volume users.

## 8. Key Flows
### Flow 1: PDF Upload and QC
1. User visits website, drags PDF into upload zone.
2. App validates (PDF, <10MB), displays "Processing" (under 5 seconds).
3. **pdf-parse** extracts text; **Tesseract.js** handles image-based sections; **LanguageTool** checks content; **OpenCV** analyzes layout.
4. Report shows: "Text Issues" (e.g., "Fix 'dat' to 'data'") and "Formatting Issues" (e.g., "Line misalignment: 3px").
5. User exports report or re-uploads corrected PDF.

### Flow 2: Image-Heavy PDF Handling
1. User uploads PDF with text and images (e.g., "CURVES DATA SHEET" with graphs).
2. **Tesseract.js** extracts text from images (e.g., graph labels); **pdf-parse** gets embedded text.
3. **OpenCV** confirms font consistency (e.g., same typeface in text and images) and flags "COMPAR" as corruption.
4. Report details all issues with image-specific notes (e.g., "Image text unreadable on Page 2").

## 9. Key Logic
- **Text Extraction (pdf-parse + Tesseract.js):**
  - Input: PDF binary.
  - Process: **pdf-parse** for embedded text; **Tesseract.js** for image text (e.g., OCR graph labels).
  - Output: Combined text (e.g., "Additional fit equations available...").
- **Text Analysis (LanguageTool):**
  - Input: Extracted text.
  - Rules: Spelling (e.g., "dat" â†’ "data"), grammar (e.g., punctuation), style (e.g., "IC50" vs. "ic50").
  - Output: Error list with fixes.
- **Visual Analysis (OpenCV):**
  - Input: PDF pages as images (via pdfjs-dist).
  - Process: Detect font styles (e.g., typeface, size), line positions (e.g., bullet alignment), spacing (pixels), anomalies (e.g., "COMPAR" patterns).
  - Output: Issues (e.g., "Font: 12pt expected, 11pt found").
- **Report Generation:**
  - Merge outputs into JSON, render in UI with clickable annotations (e.g., jump to "Line misalignment").

## 10. Launch Plan
- **Phase 1: Alpha (Weeks 1-3, Mar 10-28, 2025)**  
  - Build text QC with **pdf-parse**, **Tesseract.js**, **LanguageTool**; basic UI; test on 10 PDFs with images.
- **Phase 2: Beta (Weeks 4-6, Mar 31-Apr 18, 2025)**  
  - Add **OpenCV** for visual QC (font, lines); test with 100 users, 1,000 PDFs; deploy on Vercel.
- **Phase 3: Release (Weeks 7-9, Apr 21-May 9, 2025)**  
  - Refine UI; scale to 100+ users; launch publicly with marketing push.

## 11. Key Milestones
- **Mar 14, 2025:** Text QC (text + image) prototype complete.
- **Apr 4, 2025:** Visual QC (font, line alignment) integrated.
- **Apr 18, 2025:** Beta achieves 99% text and formatting accuracy.
- **May 9, 2025:** Public launch on Vercel, handling 1,000+ PDFs/month.

## Follow-Up Questions and Assumptions
1. **Image Complexity:** Assumed typical marketing images (e.g., graphs, logos). Are there complex elements (e.g., handwritten notes) requiring advanced OCR?
   - **Impact:** May need enhanced **Tesseract.js** tuning.
2. **Usage Scale:** Assumed 5 users (50 PDFs) growing to 100 users (1,000 PDFs) initially. What's the target max user base in Year 1 (e.g., 1,000 users)?
   - **Impact:** Affects Vercel scaling and cost planning.
3. **Font Rules:** Assumed font consistency means same typeface/size. Are there specific branding guidelines (e.g., "Arial only")?
   - **Impact:** Refines **OpenCV** logic.
4. **User Support:** Assumed no login/support initially. Should we plan for feedback channels or basic accounts?
   - **Impact:** Adds scope for Phase 3.
5. **Performance Tradeoff:** Set 5-second processing with 99% accuracy. If image-heavy PDFs slow this, prioritize speed or accuracy?
   - **Impact:** Adjusts **Tesseract.js**/**OpenCV** optimization.

## Updates and Assumptions
- **Images in PDFs:** Added **Tesseract.js** for image text extraction, critical for marketing collateral (e.g., graph labels in "CURVES DATA SHEET").
- **Public Tool:** Shifted from internal to public use, adjusting impact sizing for scalability and Vercel deployment.
- **Font Consistency:** Expanded **OpenCV** to check typeface/size and line alignment, per your emphasis.
- **99% Accuracy:** Raised formatting detection to 99% (from 95%) to match text goal, reflecting high stakes for marketing.
- **Vercel:** Kept as deployment platform per your confirmation.
